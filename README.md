ThreeJS 3D implimentation of Breakout with custom game engine.

`scripts\pack.ps1` will build the project and place the bundled code in ".\build\bin". 

`scripts/build.sh <root_folder>` where <root_folder> is the folder containing "index.html", will build the project and place the bundled code in "<root_folder>/build".

After building, open "index.html" to play!

`npm run make-dev` will build the bundle.js and allow you to play using the root folder "index.html"
